# TODO Website using React + Tailwind

This project was made to understand the functionality of React and to see its limitations further. With React and Tailwind, I built this TODO list application where the user gets a new quote at the top at each refresh and can add their tasks to the list. These tasks can be updated, completed, and deleted according to the user's choice.
